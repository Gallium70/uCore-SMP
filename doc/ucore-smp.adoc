== Introduction

*uCore-SMP* (https://github.com/TianhuaTao/uCore-SMP) is a operating system kernel based on RISC-V, with multiprocessing support. 

This project referred to MIT *xv6* (https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) heavily but are very different in various ways. For example, this kernel uses a SBI, has different syscalls, different memory layouts, different code organization and styles, and maybe more bugs. This kernel does not have logging in the filesystem or elf support as xv6 does.

uCore-SMP exists as my OS course project but I expect it to be more. This kernel implementation is extended from *ucore-Tutorial* (lab2-lab7) (https://github.com/DeathWish5/ucore-Tutorial), the Tsinghua OS course lab, which also refers to xv6. So anyway this implementation looks like xv6 very much.  =_=

I'm glad to see some other lab project ever considered using this kernel as its testing platform and did manage to run some early versions on its custom fpga. I receive advice and benefit from it.

As time is limited, not enough testing is conducted, and comments and documentation are not sufficient. Refinement will be needed.

I hope some part of this kernel implementation is better than that of xv6's, and is a good extension of *ucore-Tutorial*. I try to make the code more understandable, use names that make sense and separate modules. If anyone happen to be reading xv6 codes wondering "What does this mean", and then comes to my code, saying "Oh I got it", I feel it's a success.

== Syscall

What I list here are syscalls at user side. They may not be real syscalls. For example, `wait()` and `waitpid()` actually use the same syscall id. For real syscall ABIs, check out `os/syscall/`.

=== exec

[source, C]
----
int execv(const char *pathname, char *const argv[]);
----

The `char *const argv[]` argument is an array of pointers to null-terminated strings that represent the argument list available to the new program.  The first argument, by convention, should point to the filename associated with the file being executed.  The array of pointers must be terminated by a null pointer.

*Returns* -1 on error. Else no return.

=== exit

[source, C]
----
void exit(int status);
----

The `exit()` function causes normal process termination and the value of `status` is returned to the parent.

=== read

[source, C]
----
ssize_t read(int fd, void *dst, size_t len);
----

Read at most `len` bytes from file `fd` into `dst`.

*Returns* bytes count read. Or -1 if failed.

=== write

[source, C]
----
ssize_t write(int fd, void *src, size_t len);
----

Write `len` bytes to file `fd` from `src`.

*Returns* bytes count written successfully. Or -1 if failed.

=== getpid

[source, C]
----
pid_t getpid(void);
----

`getpid()` returns the process ID (PID) of the calling process.

*Returns* process ID.

=== getppid

[source, C]
----
pid_t getppid(void);
----

`getppid()` returns the process ID of the parent of the calling process. This will be either the ID of the process that created this process using fork(), or, if that process has already terminated, the ID of the process to which this process has been reparented or -1.

*Returns* parent process ID.

=== chdir

[source, C]
----
int chdir(const char *path);
----

`chdir()` changes the current working directory of the calling process to the directory specified in `path`.

*Returns* 

On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.

=== dup

[source, C]
----
int dup(int oldfd);
----

The `dup()` system call creates a copy of the file descriptor oldfd, using the lowest-numbered unused file descriptor for the new descriptor.

*Returns* 

On success, the system call return the new file descriptor. On error, -1 is returned.

=== fork

[source, C]
----
pid_t fork(void);
----

`fork()` creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. The new process is referred to as the child process. The calling process is referred to as the parent process.

*Returns* 

On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child. On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no child process is created

=== mkdir

[source, C]
----
int mkdir(const char *pathname);
----

`mkdir()` attempts to create a directory named `pathname`.

*Returns* zero on success, or -1 if an error occurred.


=== setpriority

[source, C]
----
int64 setpriority(int64 priority);
----

Set program scheduling priority. `priority` should be >= 2.

*Returns* the priority set, or -1 if failed.


=== getpriority

[source, C]
----
int64 getpriority();
----

Get program scheduling priority.

*Returns* priority


=== fstat

[source, C]
----
int fstat(int fd, struct stat *statbuf);
----

This function returns information about a file, in the buffer pointed to by `statbuf`.

*Returns* 

On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.

=== stat

[source, C]
----
int stat(const char *pathname, struct stat *statbuf);
----

This function returns information about a file, in the buffer pointed to by `statbuf`.

*Returns* 

On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.


=== open

[source, C]
----
int open(const char *pathname, int flags);
----

The open() system call opens the file specified by `pathname`.

*Returns* the new file descriptor, or -1 if an error occurred.

=== close

[source, C]
----
int close(int fd);
----

`close()` closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any file and may be reused.

*Returns* zero on success. On error, -1 is returned.

=== pipe

[source, C]
----
int pipe(int pipefd[2]);
----

`pipe()` creates a pipe, a unidirectional data channel that can be used for interprocess communication. The array pipefd is used to return two file descriptors referring to the ends of the pipe. `pipefd[0]` refers to the read end of the pipe. `pipefd[1]` refers to the write end of the pipe. Data written to the write end of the pipe is buffered by the kernel until it is read from the read end of the pipe.

*Returns* 

On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.

=== sched_yield

[source, C]
----
int sched_yield(void);
----

`sched_yield()` causes the calling process to relinquish the CPU.

*Returns* 

On success, `sched_yield()` returns 0. On error, -1 is returned.

=== mknod

[source, C]
----
int mknod(const char *pathname, short major, short minor)
----

The system call `mknod()` creates a filesystem node (device special file) named pathname, with attributes specified by `major` and `minor`.

*Returns* zero on success, or -1 if an error occurred.

=== wait

[source, C]
----
pid_t wait(int *wstatus);
pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int* wstatus);
----
The `wait()` system call suspends execution of the calling thread until one of its children terminates.

The `waitpid()` system call suspends execution of the calling thread until a child specified by pid argument has terminated. If `pid` < 0, it's just `wait()`;

If wstatus is not NULL, `wait()` and `waitpid()` store status information in the int to which it points.

*Returns* 

On success, returns the process ID of the terminated child; on error, -1 is returned.

=== sleep

[source, C]
----
int sleep(unsigned long long time_in_ms);
----

Put this process to sleep for at least `time_in_ms` ms.

*Returns* 0.

=== time_ms

[source, C]
----
uint64 time_ms();
----

Return a time measured in ms. Only the difference between two time return values has meaning.

*Returns* 0.

=== link

[source, C]
----
int link(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
----

`link()` creates a new link (also known as a hard link) to an existing file. If `newpath` exists, it will not be overwritten.

*Returns* 

On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.

=== unlink

[source, C]
----
int unlink(const char *pathname);
----

`unlink()` deletes a name from the filesystem. If that name was the last link to a file and no processes have the file open, the file is deleted and the space it was using is made available for reuse.

*Returns* 

On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned.

=== sharedmem

[source, C]
----
void *sharedmem(char *name, size_t len);
----

`sharedmem()` allocate a shared memory for current process. The shared memory is named by `name`, and of size `len` bytes. If no shared memory with the same time exists, one will be created using the size given. If a previous one with the same exists, then `len` should be either 0 or the previously used size, otherwise error will occur. Shared memory with the same name will be mapped to the same physical pages. When a process exited, the memory will be unmapped or freed (if necessary) by the kernel. If no process is using a shared memory, it will be freed totally, and its name can be used to create a new shared memory of different size.

`len` should be a multiple of PGSIZE (4096).

*Returns* 

On success, a non-zero address is returned, pointing at the start address of the shared memory.  On error, NULL is returned.

== Developers' Guide

=== Compile and Run

Please install `riscv-gnu-toolchain` and `qemu-system-riscv64`.

The project is organized using `make` and `cmake`. You should first compile user programs with `make user`, then compile the kernel with `make kernel` or just `make`. To run with qemu, use `make run`.

To specify the CPU core counts, modify the `CPU` variable in project makefile.

=== Log

In `utils/log.h`, use macro `LOG_LEVEL_XXX` to specify logging level. If you are not debugging, you should use `LOG_LEVEL_NONE`. For example:

[source, C]
----
// Please use one of these

// #define LOG_LEVEL_NONE
// #define LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL
// #define LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG
// #define LOG_LEVEL_INFO
// #define LOG_LEVEL_TRACE
#define LOG_LEVEL_ALL
----

The enabled macros for every level are:

LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL: `errorf`, `warnf`.

LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG: `errorf`, `warnf`, `debugf`, `debugcore`, `phex`.

LOG_LEVEL_INFO: `infof`.

LOG_LEVEL_TRACE: `infof`, `tracef`, `tracecore`.

LOG_LEVEL_ALL: Everything.

=== Memory Layout

Current implementation uses sv39 virtual memory, supporting up to 256GB user memory space. TEXT start at `0x1000`. stack bottom is at 3GB. All shared memory are mapped above user stack, each separated by a guard page.

[#fig_memory_layout]
.User Program Memory Layout
image::ucore-memory-layout.png[]

=== Multiprocessing

The matter is how to utilize more than one CPU core. 

The short answer is "locks".

==== Boot a Core

Different from xv6, this project uses a SBI (OpenSBI) to get low-level support. At start, only one core enters the kernel's `main()`, the first core shall use SBI HSM calls to get other cores running.

image::riscv-sbi-hsm.png[]


==== Locks

There are two types of locks: `spinlock` and `mutex`.

To `acuqire()` a spinlock, the cpu will keep spinning before it finally acquired it.

To `acquire_mutex_sleep()` a mutex, the cpu will try lock and go to sleep if failed, setting current process's `waiting_target` to it. When anyone is done with a mutex, it checks all processes, waking up the ones waiting for this mutex. Which woken process will get mutex is not determined.

=== Use ramdisk

In some cases, you don't have a hard disk (e.g. labeled-riscv), but you want to use the filesystem. You can use ramdisk to replace virtio-disk. Just `#define USE_RAMDISK` inside `abstract_disk.c`.

*How does the ramdisk work?*

Originally, the kernel uses `virtio_disk` (it still does), but the *label-riscv* project (check branch `label-riscv`) wants to use this project as a testing base while not having a disk hardware. The system architecture demands a disk to construct the filesystem (to make console into inodes, etc.) Therefore a ramdisk is needed.

To shift between `virtio_disk` and `ram_disk` more easily, a new layer `abstract_disk` is added. It determines at compile-time  which disk implementation to use. 

`ram_disk` will allocate enough memory during initialization, and any incoming read/write operations will be turned into kernel memory access. One thing that gets complicated is that when using `virtio_disk`, we init the disk contents before compilation (to write superblocks, etc.). But for `ram_disk` it has to be done by kernel at runtime. Check `init_ram_disk()` for more.

=== Use Shared Memory

Shared memory are easy ways for multiple processes to communicate with each other. One can create a shared memory with a name and size, and others can use it by that name. The shared memory refer to the same physical pages, but will be mapped into each process's own virtual memory system.

[#figure_shared]
.Shared memory shares physical pages
image::shared-mem.png[]

Right now you can't deallocate a shared memory except the process exits. The kernel will recycle the pages as needed.


=== Devices

The kernel supports four kinds of devices (major id): console(1), CPU(2), memory(3), proc(4).

*What are Devices?*

A device is a kind of file (fs file type: `T_DEVICE`) that can read or write. In practice, to implement a device, you should: 1) provide a `xxx_device_init()` 2) provide `xxx_write()` and `xxx_read()`. 

*How to Use Devices?*

A device is only useful when it's integrated in the file system, which means it's made into a inode by calling `mknod()`. For example, when shell launched, the first thing it does is to make device CONSOLE (major id = 1) into a file called "console". It then opens the file "console" (fd=1) and read or write to it like a regular file. The device minor number is not used.

[source, C]
----
if (open("console", O_RDWR) < 0) {
    mknod("console", 1, 0);
    open("console", O_RDWR);
}

dup(0); // stdout
dup(0); // stderr
----

The same thing happens for "cpu", "mem" and "proc". After appropriate files are made, user programs can form a resource monitor application by reading information of cpu, mem, and process like shown below.
